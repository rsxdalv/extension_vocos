# Extension adapter for Vocos

License - the source code within this repository is licensed under the MIT license.

This extension provides a neural audio codec for high-quality audio compression and reconstruction.

## Features

- Compress audio to various bitrates (1.5, 3.0, 6.0, or 12.0 kbps)
- Reconstruct high-quality audio from compressed representations
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Support for various audio file formats

## Usage

1. Upload an audio file (WAV, MP3, etc.)
2. Select the desired bandwidth (compression level) in kbps
3. Click "Reconstruct" to process the audio
4. Listen to or download the reconstructed audio

## About Vocos

Vocos is a neural audio codec developed by charactr that can compress audio to very low bitrates while maintaining high perceptual quality. It uses a neural network to encode and decode audio signals, providing better quality than traditional codecs at similar bitrates.
